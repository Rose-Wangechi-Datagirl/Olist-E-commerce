Olist data cleaning
A data analysis challenge was recently held in the Data tech space, and we were tasked as participants with exploring, cleaning, and analyzing the Olist E-commerce Public Dataset.

Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses with customers all over the country. The platform functions as a marketplace, with merchants listing their products and services and customers browsing and purchasing them online.

DATASET DESCRIPTION

The Olist sales dataset contains anonymized data from orders placed on the Olist between September 2016 and September 2018. It includes information about each order such as the order date, product details, payment and shipping information, customer and seller IDs, and customer reviews. The dataset also includes data on the sellers who list their products on Olist, as well as customer behavior and demographics. The dataset is intended to assist analysts and researchers in better understanding the e-commerce landscape in Brazil, and identify opportunities for growth and optimization.
